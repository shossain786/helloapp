Week One

Purpose of the Application:
This is a sample Spring Boot application built to understand the fundamentals of the Spring Boot framework, including REST APIs, validation, exception handling, and clean architectural layering.

Role of Packages:
Packages are used to clearly separate responsibilities, which improves readability, maintainability, and scalability of the application.

The root package is `com.saddy.helloapp`, where the `HelloappApplication` class is present. Spring Boot scans all sub-packages under this root.

Package responsibilities:
- controller: Handles HTTP requests and responses. Controllers remain thin and delegate all business logic to the service layer.
- service: Contains the core business logic of the application. All validations beyond basic annotations and business rules are implemented here.
- exception: Defines custom business exceptions and a global exception handler to provide consistent and meaningful error responses.
- model: Defines the structure of request and response objects, along with validation rules using annotations.

Golden rule (remember this forever)

Entity = DB model
DTO = API contract

----
🔹 DTOs protect you from future changes

 We can:
    - Change DB
    - Add fields
    - Refactor Entity

 Without breaking API clients.
---

🔹 Never return Entity in production APIs

 - Ever.
 - Even if “it’s a small app”.
